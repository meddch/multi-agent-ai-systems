# Investment Workflow Platform

**Level 5 Self-Improving Investment Research Workflow**

## üéØ Overview

An advanced self-improving investment workflow that demonstrates Level 5 capabilities through sequential phases, quality evaluation loops, and iterative enhancement mechanisms for institutional-grade investment research.

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Architecture

### Level 5 Self-Improving Design

Unlike Level 4 multi-agent teams that coordinate in parallel, this Level 5 workflow executes **sequential phases** with **quality feedback loops** and **self-improvement mechanisms**.

### 6-Agent Sequential Workflow

1. **Market Researcher** (Phase 1)
   - Comprehensive market data gathering
   - Company fundamentals and industry analysis
   - Real-time news and sentiment collection
   - Tools: YFinance, DuckDuckGo, reasoning tools

2. **Risk Analyst** (Phase 2)
   - Advanced portfolio risk assessment
   - VaR calculations and stress testing
   - Correlation analysis and diversification metrics
   - Tools: YFinance fundamentals, advanced analytics

3. **Portfolio Optimizer** (Phase 3)
   - Optimal allocation strategy design
   - Mean-variance optimization techniques
   - Constraint incorporation and rebalancing
   - Tools: Mathematical optimization, reasoning tools

4. **Quality Evaluator** (Phase 4)
   - Analysis quality assessment (0-1 scale)
   - Completeness and accuracy validation
   - Gap identification and improvement areas
   - **Quality Threshold**: 0.85 minimum score

5. **Improvement Strategist** (Phase 5)
   - Targeted improvement recommendations
   - Workflow optimization strategies
   - Systematic enhancement planning
   - Tools: Meta-analysis and strategic reasoning

6. **Final Validator** (Phase 6)
   - Enhanced analysis validation
   - Executive summary generation
   - Investment committee presentation
   - Final quality certification

## üîÑ Self-Improvement Mechanism

### Quality Loop Process

```
Phase 1-3: Analysis ‚Üí Phase 4: Quality Check ‚Üí Quality < 0.85?
    ‚Üì No (Quality ‚â• 0.85)              ‚Üì Yes
Phase 6: Final Output ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5: Improvement ‚Üí Restart with Enhanced Analysis
```
